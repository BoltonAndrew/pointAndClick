# Point and Click Adventure MVP

Double click will give you information about what you have clicked on (With some high quality voice acting on the newspaper :D)
Right Click will move to a location.

In terms of adding your own data in, the scene.js file in the src/utils directory is what the scene's collision map is built from, all values are based on an array of 60 items, and the key value pairs are all used.

In theory, new scene images can be added to the assets folder in the public folder and new collision arrays can be added to the src/utils/scene.js to create new locations.

Feel free to play around with it.
